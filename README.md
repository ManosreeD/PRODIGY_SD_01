# PRODIGY_SD_01
# Temperature Conversion Tool

This project is a Python-based tool for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides an easy-to-use interface to perform these conversions quickly and accurately.

# Features

Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.

Convert temperature from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.

User-friendly design with clear input and output.

# Requirements

Python 3.6 or higher

# How the Program Works

Input the Temperature:

Enter the temperature value you want to convert.

Specify the current unit of the temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin).

Choose the Target Unit:

Select the unit to which you want the temperature to be converted.

View the Results:

The program calculates and displays the converted temperature immediately.

# Example Usage

Enter the temperature value: 100
Enter the current unit (C/F/K): C
Enter the target unit (C/F/K): F
The converted temperature is: 212.0 F

# Project Structure

task1.py: The main Python script that performs the temperature conversion.

# Additional Notes

The program validates input to ensure that only valid temperature values and units are accepted.

Error handling is implemented for invalid entries.
